# Email-SMS-Automator
Tool to automate sending SMS and Email using applescript. Tool should have ability to fetch contact

Context - 
In Toastmasters, a VP-E has to send lot of mails and texts to remind people or ask people to play role. Emailing and Texting can be laborious, if one has to do it week by week basis. 

Why Applescript - I own a iPhone, Mac's application iMessage can seamlessly sync with iPhone and hence iMessage can be used to send text.

Why not bulk sms sender api - Because I wanted something free, plus I wanted to use my phone number so that recipient can reach me.
